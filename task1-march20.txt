2. Give a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.

Answer: 
Copy by value- Only the value is copied and address is not copied. So the change 
done in the assigned variable does not affect the value of the original variable.Copy by value
works only for primitive data types. Below example clearly explains copy by value.

Eg:                                       Output:
var a = 10;                   
var b = "xyz";               10, "xyz" , 20 , "mno"
c = a;
d = b;
var c = 20;
var d = "mno";
console.log(a,b,c,d)

Copy by reference- The address is copied and value is not copied. So new memory allocation is 
not done. Therefore changes in the one variable affects the other variable. Copy by reference 
works for non-primitive data types.

Eg:                                             Output:
var a = [10,20,30]; 
console.log(a);                        [ 10, 20, 30 ]   
b = a;
b.push(40);                            [ 10, 20, 30, 40 ]
console.log(a);

3. How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).

Answer:
           Using the spread (...) operator
           Using the Object.assign() method
           Using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
